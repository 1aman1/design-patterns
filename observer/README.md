Event Handling: The Observer pattern is widely used in event-driven systems and GUI frameworks. Event sources act as subjects, and various components can register as observers to receive and handle specific events. For example, in a graphical application, UI elements can subscribe to mouse or keyboard events and respond accordingly.

Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture: The Observer pattern is fundamental in the MVC architectural pattern. The model represents the subject, while views act as observers. When the model's state changes, it notifies the registered views to update their presentation based on the new data. This enables separation of concerns and helps maintain consistency between the model and its associated views.

Stock Market Updates: In financial applications, the Observer pattern can be employed to notify interested parties, such as investors or analysts, about changes in stock prices, market conditions, or other relevant data. The subject (e.g., stock market data source) publishes updates, and the observers (e.g., subscribers) receive and process the updates as needed.

Message Broadcasting: In systems where messages need to be broadcasted to multiple recipients, the Observer pattern can be utilized. The subject represents the message source, and the observers are the subscribers who receive and handle the messages. This is often seen in pub-sub (publish-subscribe) systems or messaging frameworks.
