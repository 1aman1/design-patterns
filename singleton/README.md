The Singleton class defines a GetInstance method that serves as an alternative to constructor and lets clients access the same instance of the class over and over.

Logging: A Singleton logger can be used throughout an application to centralize logging operations. All modules and components can access the logger instance to write log messages without the need for multiple logger instances.

Database Connections: In scenarios where a single database connection needs to be shared across multiple components or threads, a Singleton database connection manager can be used to ensure that only one connection is created and shared.
